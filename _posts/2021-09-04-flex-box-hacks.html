    <h1 class="title">Flexbox hacks</h1>

    <p>The Germans broke my CSS a while ago. Well, not literally, but their long words did. A few days before the issue occurred, I saw a talk by Zoe Mickley Gillenwater at Frontend United entitled “Using Flexbox Today”. That talk inspired me to solve the problem with flexbox.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Before I explain the flex-grow 9999 hack in detail, let me briefly describe what it does. The flex-grow 9999 hack makes a flex item behave like it has two flex grow values. It prevents a flex item in a row from growing, but allows it to grow if it’s wrapped into its own line. All without the use of media queries.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If that didn’t make sense, don’t worry. The example should make it clear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Imagine a flex container (display: flex) with two flex items in a row (flex-direction: row). Item A on the left, and item B on the right. Item A can not grow, so I give it a flex-grow value of 0 (the default value). Item B has to take up all the remaining space in the container. This can be done with flex-grow: 1.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I would like the flex items to be stacked on top of each other when necessary. Item B has to jump onto the second line, if there’s not enough space for it to be at least 20 ems wide. Adding flex-wrap: wrap to the container and flex-basis: 20em to item B does the job.</p>
