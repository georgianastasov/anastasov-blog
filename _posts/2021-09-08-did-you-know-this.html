    <p>I believe this is the most famous CSS meme out there, followed by the "css family guy" meme. You might have seen this somewhere, in a T-shirt, a mug or a sticker, and everybody can relate to it because it represents the frustration when trying to do a very basic thing in CSS and it doesnâ€™t work properly, but what people don't realize is that the "CSS is awesome" meme is actually a feature, not a bug!</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you had a design software that couldn't to text overflowing a box, you'd be creatively limited and pissed off. CSS Tricks has a big post on the "CSS is awesome" meme if you want to learn more, but this happens basically due to 3 things</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The content doesn't fit into its container</li>
        <li>The container can't expand to fit the content</li>
        <li>The overflow CSS property has its default to visible.</li>
    </ul>
